# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
Repository for SNHU Course CS-230-10283-M01 Operating Platforms

Once you have submitted your software design document, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Social Media company *Chat Away* has requested that they want to have developed a web-based version of their game *Draw It or Lose It*. The game already exists on Android, but they would like for it to suport multiple platforms.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
In dveloping this documentation, I feel that I did well in Explaining the Domain Model. Being able to break down each of the for important factors of object oriented programming was an important step in my growth as a developer, and I belive that I displayed that well in the Software Design Document.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
By using the Software Design Document as a template I found that the UML was especially helpful in the code build out. I also believe that the design constraints were important as they help to both define the scope of the project, and reduce scope creep.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would revise the Recommendations portion of the document. I fell that I could improve it by being more detailed in my recommendations and explantions of the platform. I feel that I could provide a more detailed deep dive into the architecture and its benefits and impediments to development.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
By taking the requirements of the user, I ensured that there was a separation between players, teams, and games ensuring that there would room for the product to grow as needed. It is important to consider the user's needs as it will imporve your relationship with one another and ensure working with them in the future is more likely.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
When approaching the design of the software, it was imporant to reference the UML. I did not fully realize the benefit of UML until this course. Using the UML allowed me to better vizualize how each working part of the application worked to build out the whole solution. Ensuring that I referenced the document constantly allowed for better code to be created with less redundancy.
